TimberWinR
==========
A Native Windows to Redis Logstash Agent which runs as a service.

## Why have TimberWinR?
TimberWinR is a native .NET implementation utilizing Microsoft's [LogParser](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd919274.aspx).  This means
no JVM/JRuby is required, and LogParser does all the heavy lifting.    TimberWinR collects
the data from LogParser and ships it to Logstash via Redis.
## Supported Input Formats

 - [WindowsEvents](https://github.com/efontana/TimberWinR/blob/master/WindowsEvents.md)
 - IIS Logs (W3C)
 - LogFiles (Tailing of files)
 - TCP Port
## Supported Output Formats
 - Redis

## Sample Configuration
TimberWinR reads a JSON configuration file, an example file is shown here:
```json
{
"TimberWinR": {
    "Inputs": {
        "WindowsEvents": [
            {
                "source": "System,Application",
                "binaryFormat": "PRINT",
                "resolveSIDS": true
            }
        ]
    },
    "Outputs": {
        "Redis": [
            { 
                "host": [
                    "server1.host.com"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
This configuration collects Events from the Windows Event Logs (System, Application) and forwards them
to Redis.
